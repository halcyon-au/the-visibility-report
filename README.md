This is a project with the goal to present [OONI (Open Observatory of Network Interference) data](https://ooni.org/data/) in a matter that makes sense to the general audience, bringing to light the censorship that some people worldwide experience.

We want to give an insight to information that we take for granted being blocked from view for many.
